# Traffic Sign Segmentation and Classification using YOLOv8 

This repository contains the code and results for a traffic sign segmentation and classification project using the YOLOv8 model on a dataset of road signs. The dataset includes four distinct classes: Traffic Light, Stop, Speed Limit, and Crosswalk. The project was carried out in three stages: an initial evaluation of a pre-trained YOLOv8n model, fine-tuning with data augmentation, and final re-training with additional augmentations.

# Why Include a PDF Version of the Notebook?
I've included a PDF version of the Jupyter notebook to ensure that the project's results and content are easily accessible, even if you're unable to view the .ipynb file directly on GitHub. Notebooks can sometimes be too large to display properly or require additional setup to view, so the PDF provides a convenient way to review the work without needing to render the notebook.

Feel free to explore the code and results, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback!
